2007-07-29  2.4.0   - rewrote argument passing, resolves problems with
                      some PHP interpreters and import_request_variables
                    - did full warning hunt on 3 drastically different
                      hosts
                    - enhanced to use redirect-after-post pattern for
                      more consistent web experience
                    - qualified PHP5 compatibility, now that PHP4 has
                      an end-of-life date

                      form's responses

                    - if there are problems writing to the datafile, the
