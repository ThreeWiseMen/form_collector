Form Collector - PHP Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
------------

The Three Wise Men Form Collector is a system that lets your web site
receive forms hold the information for later retrieval by an authorized
individual.

It is an excellent alternative to "mail gateways" that take form
information and e-mail them to that authorized individual. There are
several reasons you may wish to use Form Collector instead of a "mail
gateway":

1. Increased Security

Email is insecure, and can be intercepted and read on its way to your
computer. While it is possible to send secure email (via authentication
and signing technologies like PGP), most users do not have the patience
to set something like this up.

You can protect the forms and the Form Collector behind an SSL secured web
server. This ensures that private information is kept private.

2. Increased Convenience

Email is typically received at a single computer. If you would like to
monitor your form responses you can do so from any computer by logging in
to your Form Collector administration. This also makes it convenient to
share posted form data among several people.

If you use Form Collector to conduct surveys or polls, it will
conveniently format the responses in a way that is easily downloaded and
analyzed by your spreadsheet.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q. But I like receiving email when users fill out my forms!

A. No problem! Form Collector can send you notification when new responses
   arrive, it just won't send any (potentially private) information from
   the response to you by email.

Q. Do I have to do any special programming on my forms?

A. No. You can direct any web form to Form Collector just as you might
   have used an email gateway. Form Collector lets you label the fields
   too, to make them easier to understand.

   Be careful using Checkbox form elements, however - each combination
   of checkbox options will appear to be a new form. You are best to avoid
   checkbox elements in favour of a pair of radio-buttons.

System Requirements
-------------------

Form Collector requires that your web server support PHP version 4.1.0 or
higher.

Installation
------------

Go to where you unpacked this distribution, and edit the
web/config.ini file. This file contains the configuration settings for your
Form Collector installation.

The configuration is broken into 2 sections, "default" and "email".

In the default section, you'll see two lines, one starting with 'datafile'
and one starting with 'licensee'. Change the text after the '=' sign
to suit your installation.

datafile - this is the data file that contains all of your responses. It
           is scrambled to protect private information

licensee - this is the name of the licensee of the software (your company
           name, or your client's company name normally goes here)

ie.

[default]
datafile = /vhome/domainname.com/httpdocs/fc/private.dat
licensee = Three Wise Men

In the email section, you'll see two lines, one starting with 'identifier'
and one starting with 'fromaddress'.

identifier  - this is the prefix used in the Subject line of your
              notification emails
fromaddress - this is the email address from whom the notification emails
              are sent.

ie.

[email]
identifier = Form Collector
fromaddress = Form Collector <info@yourdomain.com>

Create a folder on your web site to hold FormCollector, and FTP all of
the files under the web/ folder into it.

Open the Form Collector's index.php in your web browser. If you uploaded
the files in a folder called "admin" for example, open your browser to "
http://domainname.com/admin/". You should see the Form Collector
installation screen.

You will have to enter a password (to protect access to the application)
and an email address (to receive notifications when new postings arrive).

After you fill out the installation form, an empty DATAFILE will be
created for you. At this point, if you log into the Form Collector you
will not see any forms because none have posted to the Form Collector yet.

In order to see a form in the Form Collector, you must post from your
form!

Making Forms
------------

Any HTML form is compatible with Form Collector, you just have to set the
form's "action" and a target to where the visitor will be forwarded after
a successful form posting.

That said, you should avoid using Checkbox elements on your forms. When
a form contains a checkbox, unless you take extra precautions, there is
no way for Form Collector to know that the element was in the form unless
it was actually checked. This will make a form with a checkbox look like
actually two different forms, one with it checked, and one without. Web
developers are often familiar with this situation, and may have their
own way of dealing with it. The easy way out is to avoid checkbox
elements and use two radio-buttons instead or a pulldown-menu instead.

The Form Collector receptor is called "receptor.php", this file will
become the target for any of your forms. For example, here is a simple
form:

  <form method="post" action="/admin/receptor.php">
  <input type="hidden"
         name="target"
         value="http://domainname.com/thankyou.html">
  <input type="hidden" name="debug" value="yes">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="submit">
  </form>

This form assumes that you uploaded Form Collector to a folder called
"admin" on your web site.

Notice the two hidden fields - target and debug. These will be somewhat
familiar if you have used email gateways in the past.

target - where to forward the browser after submitting the form data,
         normally this would be some kind of thank-you page
debug  - instead of forwarding the browser, output what data was
         submitted

Note that when debug is specified, the browser does not forward to the
target after the form is posted, nor is the posted data actually stored
within Form Collector. It is good practice to leave both lines in while
building your form, and then remove the debug line for final testing.

Customizing The Form Display
----------------------------

The administrative interface should be fairly easy to navigate for you.
Note that you can customize the names of the form fields that are
displayed to the site administrator. This can be convenient if you have
short field names in the form, and want to show more descriptive labels.

Downloading Posted Data
-----------------------

You can download the posted data at any time, the format is CSV which
opens nicely in spreadsheet programs.

You may find it convenient (especially on higher traffic sites) to
download and collect the form postings in a local spreadsheet file and
clear the responses on the server. While the server can likely handle
hundreds or even thousands of responses before it starts to visibly slow
down, it is good practice to keep a local backup of your information.

Canadian Privacy Legislation
----------------------------

Canadian businesses are required by law starting January 2004 to adhere to
Bill C6, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.

Under this new legislation you are responsible for the way you handle your
clients' personal information.

If you collect personal information from individuals, you are required to
state why you are collecting that information, and you are only allowed to
use it for that particular purpose.

Individuals are entitled to request access to any personal information you
might have on file for them.

You must take measures to ensure that any personal information that you
collect remains protected - you are responsible!
